# Project-R.O.V.E.R.
Project R.O.V.E.R. is my final year design project.

The "Simulation" folder contains the necessary python code for executing the simulation of the designed vehicle. 
To be able to write the simulated data to csv file uncomment code within main loop labelled "CSV" and add current directory
